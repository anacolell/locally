### What is locally?
Locally is a mobile app that brings together travellers and locals based on their mutual interests. 

### Who is locally for? 
For all those travellers who are looking for authentic and memorable experiences when visiting new places. If you are the kind of traveller who is interested in connecting with locals so you can get access to the best tips and recommendations, or even meet up with them, locally is for you! Don't fall anymore for any tourist traps, but feel like a local instead. 

### How does it work?
* Simply sign up and create a profile with basic information about yourself.
* Add your interests, the more the better! This will help get you the best local matches.

* Search for locals in the city you're going to be visiting. 
 There are two options: 
  * **Let's go!** Will find locals ordered by the highest match to the lowest. 
  * **I'm feeling adventurous!** If you feel like getting out of your comfort zone, by choosing 'I'm feeling lucky' you'll be matched to a completely random local. This is a great opportunity to meet people who you wouldn't meet otherwise.

* After that, you can click on a local's profile and contact them through the chat function. If you decide to meet, you can create a meetup that will be saved to your profile.
